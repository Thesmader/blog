### The problem

At my day job I was working on the mobile application for the sellers on the
marketplace. This application allows the sellers to add new products to their
store, and the product needs to have a few images. So, the app has a multi-step
form for adding the product to the store, and this form includes a step that asks
the seller to upload images for the product.

Usually the product has around 4-5 images. Earlier, the images picked by the user
were stored in the state and at the end of the `Add Product` form, these images
were uploaded sequentially. This works well for 4-5 images in a single product
form.

Then, we had to introduce variants for the products. Now with variants, a single
product could have multiple variants (a product with multiple sizes, colors).
With this feature, now let's say a product has 5-6 variants and each of these variants
can have upto 6 images. So the maximum image count for adding a single product
with variants was now `6 x number of variants`.

Uploading all these images at once in the end of `Add Product` form was certainly
not feasible. With a lot of sellers using mobile data, using this approach would
lead to a bad experience for the seller. It would take quite a lot of time for
uploading the images, and adds a huge single point of failure in the process.

### The solution

As you might have guessed from the title, I used isolates to solve this problem.
In Dart, concurrency is handled using isolates. Let's see how the solution works.

Earlier, the `Add Product` form had a single step for picking the images. With
variants, now there was a step to add details for the variants which also allows
the seller to pick images for each variant.

For the solution, as soon as the seller picks images for a single variant, the picked
images are converted into a list of bytes representing the image data. Then this
data is passed as an argument to a function that runs in a separate isolate, which
is spawned when the seller navigates to the `Add Product` form.

Since this upload process is now happening in a separate thread, it doesn't block the execution in
the main thread, and the seller can continue working with the other variants
while the images are being uploaded to the server. This provides a much better
experience to the seller since now they can easily keep editing the form, while
the image uploads are happening in parallel. By the time, the seller is done editing
the form, the images are uploaded already and they can proceed to submit the form.

### Taking it further

With variants it was also likely that a few of the images picked by the sellers
might be the same across all variants. It doesn't make sense to upload the same
image more than once, so adding a simple in-memory cache to keep track of the images
being uploaded helped with this. To achieve this, a simple map keeps track of
the uploaded images with the local file path of the image being the key and the
url for the uploaded image as the value. When an image is picked, if the file path
exists as a key in this map, the value of this key is used directly instead of
uploading the image again to the server.
